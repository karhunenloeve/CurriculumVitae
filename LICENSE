1. The above pawright notice and this pawmission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Catware.

2. The User agrees to provide at least one treat, chin scratch, or soft blanket
   to the nearest available cat upon usage of the Catware.

3. The Catware is provided "as is", with no warranty of any kind, express or

   are legally obligated to surrender control. It‚Äôs probably still better than Vim.
